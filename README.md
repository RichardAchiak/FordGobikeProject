- Bike ID
- User Type
- Member_gender
- Member_birth_year
- Bike_share_for_all_trips


## Summary of Findings
- Most trips were done at Afternoon (12:00 - 17:59 hours) representing 38.3%, followed closely by Morning (00:00 - 11:59 hours) representing 38.5%. Night had 23.2% of all users which is reasonable.

- Most trip were done on midweek which is Thursday, this was followed by Tuesday and wednesday respectively. Weekends seem the list patronage of this service.
- Most trips representing 90.5% were taken by subscribers with the remaining 9.5% being just casual riders. This shows that subscribers were making efficient use of thier subscription.
- Mojority of the gobike users are between the ages of 21 to 40 years respectively as these age groups constitute almost 80% of all users.
- All member gender having almost the same average age and containing a number of outliers.
- The same average age for both subscribers and customers
- Time of the day with most trips was Morning and afternoon for subscribers and that of customers was afternoon which makes time of the day slightly dependent on if a user is a subscriber or a customer.

## Key Insights for Presentation
Focus was based on just looking at the time of the day and the day of the week with most trips, how long does the average trip take? and to find out if the results depend on user type.
The presentation showed that there indeed is a dependency of the average trip duration on user type. On average, customers rides lasted longer than subscribers rides on every day of the week and time of the day.
